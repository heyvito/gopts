The Interspatial Manipulator (or `interman`) is a dummy library that loads environment
variables into a given struct.

## Installing

1. Download and install it
```
$ go get -u github.com/victorgama/interman
```

2. Import it in your code:
```go
import "github.com/victorgama/interman"
```

## Usage

This is a really short crash-course. More information can be found on [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/victorgama/interman). Assuming an environment with two variables `USERNAME` and `AUTO_RESTART` set to `John` and `false`, respectively, running the following snippet of code:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/victorgama/interman"
    "fmt"
)

type Settings struct {
    Username    string
    AutoRestart bool    `default:"true"`
}

func main() {
    settings := interman.LoadEnvs(Settings{}).(Settings)
    fmt.Println(settings.Username)
    fmt.Println(settings.AutoRestart)
}
```

Will yield the following output:

```
John
false
```
